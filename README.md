## Overview
  A simple application to display data from a microcontroller connected via USB. Using a simple serial commands the microcontroller sends data to the phone via channels; for example, if a given microcontroller has 4 analog inputs, one may provide 4 channels of data to the Android device. Using these channels the user can dynamically add widgets as they see fit by using another form on the application.
  
  ## Widgets
    1. Small round gauge - Simple airplane style gauge.
    2. Large round gauge - Larger gauge with needle and tick marks; designed to be looked at from a larger distance. 
    3. Small bar graph - Simple bar graph to compare data with a user designed scale. 
    4. Table - Seperates specified data channels into rows and columns.
